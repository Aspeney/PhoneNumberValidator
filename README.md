Application Description
This application interprets sequences of spoken-style number groups (e.g., “30 2 5 58”) and reconstructs them into full natural numbers, simulating how phone numbers may be dictated in parts. It validates whether the resulting number is a valid Greek telephone number and, when ambiguities exist in how numbers could be combined, it generates all possible interpretations and indicates which ones are valid phone numbers.

How to use:
When launched, the application will ask you for space-separated numbers. Provide the numbers you wish to validate and press Enter to receive a complete list of number interpretations.
